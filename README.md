## Module2

### 1) Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

- This stock analysis is done to help Steve, for assisting his parents to invest in right green energy stock.

- As his parents without much research wants to invest in DAQO new energy corporation. So Steve has created an Excel with DAQO and also other green energy stocks so we can compare and analyse which stocks are good to invest.

- This is done by 1) Calculating total daily Volume for each stocks
                  2) Calculating yearly returns for each stocks.

##### Calculating total daily Volume 
To check if the stock is traded often and to find yearly volume - we sum all the daily Volume for each stock.

##### Calculating yearly returns
Yearly returns are calculated to know the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year 


### 2) Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
- We first look into DQ stock - The company had 200% returns for the year 2017 with daily volume of 35 million stocks. The company had significant drops of returns in 2018 of 63% and daily volume of 108 million.

- From the list of stocks provided in the Excel sheet - the overall market in 2017 and performnace of individual stocks looks postive with good returns to investers. Whearas 2018 the overall stocks and returns has dropped significantly. If the drop was due to the company performance (revenue) , then Steve parents had to hold there investments.If this was due to any market issue , then all these stock may go up again.
